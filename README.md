# flipboard-for-mac
A Flipboard Mac app made in Electron

###Instructions

To download, simple clone the repo or download the FlipboardForMac.app file to run on your Mac.

###Requirements

This runs off Electron and simply loads Flipboard into the chromium instance. There's nothing special or crazy going on here.

This should work just the same as if you were to load Flipboard into Chrome.
